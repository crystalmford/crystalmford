# Hi, I’m Crystal Ford

I’m a Data Scientist with a Master of Science in Data Analytics – Data Science (WGU), specializing in machine learning, forecasting, deep learning, and model deployment. My portfolio includes SQL-driven Tableau dashboards, predictive APIs, and advanced analytics projects that combine technical rigor with human-centered storytelling.

Before pivoting into tech, I co-founded a nonprofit that helped Native organizations modernize their data systems without compromising sovereignty or security. We ran a real-world fundraising campaign and implemented Salesforce to show how modern platforms could be used safely and effectively. One of our first partnerships was with a women’s shelter still keeping records in handwritten notebooks, and that moment changed everything. It taught me that data work is human work, and the right tools can be transformative.

Even earlier, I spent more than a decade homeschooling two exceptional young women, helping them grow into curious, capable, and confident individuals. That experience made me a communicator as much as a problem-solver and gave me a lifelong respect for clarity, empathy, and tenacity.
