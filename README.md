# Hi, I’m Crystal Ford

I’m a Data Scientist with a Master of Science in Data Analytics - Data Science (WGU), specializing in machine learning, forecasting, deep learning, and model deployment. My portfolio includes SQL-driven Tableau dashboards, predictive APIs, and advanced analytics projects that bridge technical rigor with clear, human-centered storytelling.

Before pivoting into tech, I co-founded a nonprofit dedicated to helping Native organizations modernize their data systems without compromising sovereignty or security. We ran a real-world fundraising campaign and implemented Salesforce to demonstrate how modern platforms could be used safely and effectively. One of our first partnerships was with a women’s shelter where records were still kept in handwritten notebooks, and that moment changed everything. It taught me that data work is human work, and that the right tools can be transformative.

Even earlier, I spent more than a decade homeschooling two exceptional young women — helping them grow into curious, capable, and confident individuals. That experience made me a communicator as much as a problem-solver and gave me a lifelong respect for clarity, empathy, and tenacity.

**Things I love:**  
Data storytelling, cats on keyboards, Marvel movies, crochet charts, and cracking open a Diet Coke while debugging Python.
